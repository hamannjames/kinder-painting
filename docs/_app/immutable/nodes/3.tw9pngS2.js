My name is Ken Kinder. My wife Becky and I started this business 20 years ago and are still going strong. Through the years we’ve seen a lot of changes, but one thing that hasn’t changed is our commitment to quality service and craftsmanship.</p> <p>Thorough preparation is essential to doing any job properly. Quality materials are important to achieve a long lasting paint job. You want to hire somebody who has the experience and the expertise to handle any problem that may arise when tackling your interior or exterior paint job. Kinder Painting is fully equipped to handle all your commercial and residential painting needs. We have built a reputation for quality workmanship and honest value. Most of our business comes from repeat customers and referrals from satisfied customers. When you call for a free, no-obligation, quote for your project you’ll receive a detailed and concise cost breakdown as well as product and procedural recommendations based on your needs and budget.</p> <p>We use primarily Sherwin Williams paint for their quality materials and deep product line. We also use products from a wide variety of other manufacturers. Here are a few of the services offered by Kinder Painting:
        Pressure washing, concrete sealing, siding repair, drywall repair, dry-rot repair, deck repair, lead testing, window replacement, door replacement, texturing, masonry cleaning &amp; sealing, staining, trim installation and more.

I look forward to hearing from you.</p>`,o,a,r,i;return r=new K({}),{c(){t=m("section"),t.innerHTML=c,o=w(),a=m("div"),v(r.$$.fragment),this.h()},l(e){t=d(e,"SECTION",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),x(t)!=="svelte-zujzdd"&&(t.innerHTML=c),o=b(e),a=d(e,"DIV",{class:!0});var n=_(a);k(r.$$.fragment,n),n.forEach(s),this.h()},h(){u(t,"class","px-8 py-12 text-base space-y-6 max-w-vw-limit mx-auto"),u(a,"class","bg-icicle-200")},m(e,n){l(e,t,n),l(e,o,n),l(e,a,n),j(r,a,null),i=!0},p:h,i(e){i||($(r.$$.fragment,e),i=!0)},o(e){q(r.$$.fragment,e),i=!1},d(e){e&&(s(t),s(o),s(a)),M(r)}}}class H extends g{constructor(t){super(),y(this,t,null,S,f,{})}}export{H as component};
